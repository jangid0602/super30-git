# 📘 Week 3 – Data Structures Story Assignments

## 📌 Overview

This repository contains solutions and implementations for **Week 3 Story Tasks**, focused on core **Data Structures** concepts such as **Stacks, Queues, Linked Lists, and Pointers**.
Each problem is designed to test logical thinking, in-place manipulation, and efficient time/space complexity.

## 📂 Problem Statements

### 1️⃣ The O(1) Average Stack

**Topic:** Stack
Design a stack that supports `push`, `pop`, `top`, and `getAverage()` — all in **O(1)** average time.

---

### 2️⃣ The Python Indentation Validator

**Topic:** Stack
Validate Python indentation rules using a stack-based approach to ensure proper block structure.

---

### 3️⃣ The 2D Linked List Transpose

**Topic:** Linked List, Pointers
Transpose a 2D linked list **in-place** by swapping `right` and `down` pointers.

---

### 4️⃣ The K-Zipline Merge

**Topic:** Linked List, Pointers
Merge two linked lists by alternately zipping **k nodes** from each list.

---

### 5️⃣ The Prime / Composite List Partition

**Topic:** Linked List
Rearrange a linked list so that:

* Prime numbers come first
* Composite numbers next
* `1` appears at the very end
  (Relative order must be preserved.)

---

### 6️⃣ The Leaky Bucket Queue

**Topic:** Queue
Simulate a network buffer with fixed capacity where overflow causes the **oldest item to be dropped**.

---

### 7️⃣ The C-String Interweaver

**Topic:** Pointers (C/C++)
Interleave two C-style strings character by character using **manual memory management**.

---

### 8️⃣ The Collapsing Count List

**Topic:** Linked List, Stack
Collapse adjacent nodes with the same value by summing their counts until no duplicates remain.

---

### 9️⃣ The Zigzag Multi-Level Flatten

**Topic:** Linked List, Queue (Deque)
Flatten a multi-level doubly linked list using **zigzag (alternating) traversal order** by depth.

---

## 🚀 Key Learning Outcomes

* Mastery of stack and queue applications
* In-place linked list manipulation
* Pointer handling and memory management
* Writing efficient, clean, and scalable code
* Thinking beyond standard solutions

---

## ✅ Notes

* All solutions are expected to be **optimized**
* Extra credit for clean structure and creative logic
* Follow proper coding standards and documentation
